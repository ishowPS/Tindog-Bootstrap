TinDog is a responsive and non-interactive website created for practice purposes using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The main focus of this project was on Bootstrap, and the following elements were learned during its development:

Bootstrap Carousel
Bootstrap Cards
Bootstrap Navbar
Grid Layout
Containers
Media Query

The website's design is visually appealing and engaging, featuring a carousel of images and cards that showcase different dog breeds. The navbar is fixed and contains links to different sections of the website. The grid layout and containers were used to create a well-structured and organized design, and media queries were implemented to ensure the website's responsiveness on different devices.

As the developer, I am clear with the concepts learned during this project and am excited to move on to learning JavaScript. TinDog is a perfect example of the skills and knowledge gained during my practice, and I am confident in my ability to apply these skills in future projects.

Thank you for visiting TinDog
